# Track Degradation Prediction

This project aims to predict the date on which specific standard deviation (SD) threshold values — used as safety or maintenance indicators — are expected to be reached due to track degradation over time.

The model is trained on historical track condition data and performs regression-based forecasting to estimate critical failure or maintenance dates.
The dataset is confidential and bulky in size.
